\description{
This data frame contains harvest information on all heads
  harvested from p1, p2, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9 and tplot in 2021. There are a total of 830
  records. 
  This data frame was generated by the script 
  makehh2021.r, which is saved in 
  ~Dropbox/CGData/140_reconcile/reconcile2021/reconcile2021_work.
  The records come from the reconciled harvest list in ~Dropbox/CGData/140_reconcile/reconcile2021/reconcile2021_out.
